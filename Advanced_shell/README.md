| Biologists | [Intermediate bash](https://hbctraining.github.io/Training-modules/Intermediate_shell/) | 2-3 hour workshop (~2-3 hours of trainer-led time) |


### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a **2 hour**, hands-on **Intermediate bash** workshop led at a relaxed pace. Many tools for the analysis of big data require knowledge of the command line, and this workshop will build on the skills taught in the **Introduction to the command-line interface** workshop and **Intermediate bash** Current Topics module. This workshop will further expand our shell toolkit to cover topics with a wide array of data science applications. This module provides hands-on learning for the following topics: string manipulation, regular expressions, sed and awk. 

### Learning Objectives

* Manipulate string from existing bash variables
* Implement regular expression within a grep search
* Apply basic stream-editing principles to a file 
* Use awk to extract columns and do basic arithmetic from table data 

> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but also amenable to self-guided learning.
