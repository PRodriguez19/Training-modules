The ML4bio workshop is hands-on. Please follow this setup guide to download the workshop materials and install the ml4bio software on the computer you will use for the workshop. Note that the ml4bio software is for educational use only and should not be used for research. The software runs on Mac OS, Windows, and Linux. If you do not already use the Python Anaconda distribution, the guide provides instructions for installing Anaconda first. Please carefully note the recommendation to add Anaconda to your PATH, which is not the default option.
