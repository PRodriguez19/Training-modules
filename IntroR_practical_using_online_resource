# Introduction to R - Practical workshop

## Description

R is a simple programming environment that enables the effective handling of data, while providing excellent graphical support. RStudio is a tool that provides a user-friendly environment for working with R. This workshop requires prior completion of our [Introduction to R online resource](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/hcatrresource/video-library), developed in collaboration with Harvard Catalyst. This Introduction to R practical workshop will address questions regarding the content of the resource and provide practical exercises to practice your newly developed R skills. 

## Learning Objectives

* **R syntax:** Understanding the different 'parts of speech' in R; introducing variables and functions, demonstrating how functions work, and modifying arguments for specific use cases.
* **Data structures in R:** Getting a handle on the classes of data structures and the types of data used by R.
* **Data inspection and wrangling:** Reading in data from files. Using indices and various functions to subset, merge, and create datasets.
* **Exporting data:** Generating new data tables for use outside of the R environment.
* **Visualizing data:** Demonstrate the use of the ggplot2 package to create plots for easy data visualization.

## Installations

Download the most recent versions of R and RStudio:
