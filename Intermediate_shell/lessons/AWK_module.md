## What is AWK?

If you have ever looked up how to do a particular string manipulation in [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or [biostars](https://www.biostars.org/) then you have probably seen someone give an AWK command as a potential solution. 

AWK is an interpreted programming language designed for text processing and typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool. It was created at Bell Labs in the 1970s and AWK comes from from the surnames of its authors: Alfred **A**ho, Peter **W**einberger, and **B**rian Kernighan. `awk` shares a common history with `sed` and even `grep` dating back to `ed`. As a result, some of the syntax and functionality can be a bit familiar at times. 

## I already know grep and sed, why should I learn AWK?
