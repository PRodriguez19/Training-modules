# Functions practical

1. Let's first create a function `f_to_c`, which converts temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. The formula is as follows: `temp_c = (temp_f - 32) * 5 / 9`. Test your function - `f_to_c(32)` should give output of 0.

2. Then let's create another function `c_to_k`, which converts temperature from Celsius to Kelvin. The formula is as follows: `temp_k = temp_c + 273.15`. Test your function - `c_to_k(0)` should give output of 273.15.

3. Using the two functions above, write one line code that converts temperature of 32 in Fahrenheit to corresponding temperature in Kelvin. Hint: think about "nesting" one function inside another one.
